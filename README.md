# Fictive

Authoring framework for choice fiction. An extraction from **[Muturangi](http://maetl.net/talks/narrative-anxiety)**.

## Disclaimer

This is a very basic, very sketchy draft extraction of some of the components I wrote to support turning my novel manuscript into an interactive choice-driven experience. It doesn’t yet support the full range of features of the original code and won’t be considered production ready until **Muturangi** is in production.
